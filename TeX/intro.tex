\section{Introduction}

The large scale success of cryptocurrency platforms such as Bitcoin  \cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin} and Ethereum \cite{wood2014ethereum} and many others stands to change the nature of computational networks as we know them. Bitcoin has proven to be a reliable way to transfer value in a secure and efficient manner and Ethereum is showing great promise in the de-centralization not only of transaction management but also of software execution in general. 


Topics in intro
\begin{itemize}
	\item crypto background
	\item review of proof of work algorithms
	\item motivate graph coloring as proof of work (present applications, etc)
	\item summarize our contribution
\end{itemize}


Ideas for algorithm.
\begin{itemize}
	\item We proposed to generate graph from the hash of the previous block.
	\item Proof of work comes from providing a valid colouring of the resulting graph.
	\item The validity of a colouring can be verified in linear time.
	\item We can tune difficulty by generating graphs with varying connectivities and connectivity patterns.
	\item Problem: asking for a $k$ colouring of a graph is not guaranteed to yield a solution.
	\item We proposes to ask for a $k$ colouring that is bounded by the max degree (Brooks theorem: in a connected graph in which every vertex has at most $\Delta$ neighbors, the vertices can be colored with only $\Delta$ colors, except for two cases, complete graphs and cycle graphs of odd length, which require $\Delta + 1$ colors) and number of edges of the graph. There is the issue of producing graphs with a sufficiently large gap between the two bounds. Alessandro is working on guiding the design of the graphs, potentially inducing cliques.
	\item Alternate proposition: miners work on the branch with the maximum difficulty. In this case, miners would look at the total number of colors used in the branch and mine on the one with the smallest number. If a miner decides to provide trivial colorings, then they would be contributing less difficulty to the branch and run the chance of their branch not being mined on. This solves the problem of not a $k$ coloring not being guaranteed to exist.
